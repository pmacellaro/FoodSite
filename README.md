# FoodSite
A tool for learning about nutritional information about various food items as related to assorted science facts and fun achievements. The dieting website nobody asked for!

User Experience:
    Select food items from a pre-built menu with mouse-over displaying nutritional information of single food items. Add and remove food items to a plate to see total nutritional information. Submit custom food items to create new food items on the menu. Unlock new achievements and facts about the total nutritional information as total calories increases. 

Features:
    Listeners:
        Click food items from menu to add to plate
        Click food items from plate to remove from plate
        Submit food form to add food item to menu (POST working)
        Mouseover food items to view nutritional information
            Mouseout hides nutritional information
    Auto-updating Lists:
        Science facts, unlocked based on total nutritional values of plate
        Achievement goalposts for total calories of plate 
    API made-from-scratch with resources:
        Food items
        Achievements

Would-like:
    Drag and drop (js - stretch)
    Rate the meal button (js - listener)
    mouseover/mouseout styled as nutritional box (css)

Next-steps:
    Food item tiered unlocking (game)
    Food form remodeled as food selector from db.json library (game)
    Persisting: plate, facts, achievements (restructuring db.json)
    Facts not hard-coded into index.js (restructuring db.json)
